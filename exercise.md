Sure, let's add this step to the exercise.

**The Pokémon Challenge**

Brock is a Gym Leader in the world of Pokémon, and numerous trainers with their Pokémon arrive to battle him every day. He uses a web application to manage the incoming trainers and determine whether their Pokémon are eligible for a battle. Your task is to assist Brock by enhancing his application.

The application uses the Pokémon API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id}) to get data about the Pokémon who are knocking on the door for a battle. Brock has a predefined array of Pokémon IDs, for example:

```jsx
const pokemonIds = [1, 4, 7, 25, 152, 155, 158];
```

From this array, the application should randomly select an ID and use it to fetch the corresponding Pokémon data from the API. The Pokémon object returned by the API has the following structure:

```json
{
    "pokemon": {
        "name": "pikachu",
        "types": ["electric"],
        "powerLevel": 55
    }
}
```

Additionally, the Gym has a record of certain Pokémon originating from different regions and their types. This information is structured as follows:

```jsx
const pokemonRegions = [
    {
        region: 'Kanto',
        pokemons: {
            'Bulbasaur': ['grass', 'poison'],
            'Charmander': ['fire'],
            'Squirtle': ['water'],
            'Pikachu': ['electric']
        }
    },
    {
        region: 'Johto',
        pokemons: {
            'Chikorita': ['grass'],
            'Cyndaquil': ['fire'],
            'Totodile': ['water']
        }
    }
]
```

The web application should have two buttons:

1. **Check who is knocking**: When clicked, the application should randomly select an ID from the `pokemonIds` array, fetch the corresponding Pokémon data from the API, and display the Pokémon's name and the region it originates from (determined from the `pokemonRegions` data).

2. **Check if the Pokémon can battle**: This button should check if the Pokémon's power level is above a certain threshold (you can decide on the value). If it's above the threshold, the Pokémon is allowed to battle, and a confirmation message should be displayed. If it's below the threshold, an error should be thrown and caught, informing Brock that this Pokémon isn't strong enough for a battle.

Your task is to create a user-friendly interface for Brock to interact with. Remember to account for potential exceptions (for example, a Pokémon's region or name not being found in the `pokemonRegions` object). Good luck!
